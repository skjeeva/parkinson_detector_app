# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project uses a neural network with explainability via SHAP to detect Parkinson's disease from vocal measurements.

## Features
- Deep Learning (TensorFlow)
- SHAP Explainability
- Streamlit Web App
- Real-time CLI predictions
- Hyperparameter tuning

## How to Run
1. Train the model:
```bash
python models/model_builder.py
